# Some economists have responded positively to Bitcoin, including 
# Francois R. Velde, senior economist of the Federal Reserve in Chicago 
# who described it as "an elegant solution to the problem of creating a 
# digital currency." In November 2013 Richard Branson announced that 
# Virgin Galactic would accept Bitcoin as payment, saying that he had invested 
# in Bitcoin and found it "fascinating how a whole new global currency 
# has been created", encouraging others to also invest in Bitcoin.
# Other economists commenting on Bitcoin have been critical. 
# Economist Paul Krugman has suggested that the structure of the currency 
# incentivizes hoarding and that its value derives from the expectation that 
# others will accept it as payment. Economist Larry Summers has expressed 
# a "wait and see" attitude when it comes to Bitcoin. Nick Colas, a market 
# strategist for ConvergEx Group, has remarked on the effect of increasing 
# use of Bitcoin and its restricted supply, noting, "When incremental 
# adoption meets relatively fixed supply, it should be no surprise that 
# prices go up. And thatâ€™s exactly what is happening to BTC prices."
